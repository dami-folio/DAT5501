## Code Portfolio

This repository acts as a code portfolio for university.

The contents of the 'Portfolio' folder within this repository are being submitted as the primary part of the assignment, but the other contents of this repository corresponding to set lesson tasks (e.g. unit testing activity) can also be treated as part of the assignment.
