## Code Portfolio

This repository acts as a code portfolio for university module DAT5501.

The contents of the 'Portfolio' folder within this repository are being submitted as the primary part of the assignment, but the other contents of this repository corresponding to set lesson tasks (e.g. unit testing activity) can also be treated as part of the assignment. 

The portfolio folder contains several subfolders which hold relevant code. Each subfolder will have a README file, which will explain the purpose of the code and the expected output. Folders which have multiple pieces of code will explain the purpose of each piece of code in the README file.
