# GOAL: create a program that prints out a calendar based on user input.
# it should be able to take the number of days in a month and the day that each week starts on.
# the first line should be the days of the week: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun.
# NOTE: if the week starts on wednesday, then the numbered days should start from wednesday. the spaces for monday and tuesday should be blank.
