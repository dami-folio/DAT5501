### Line Fitter Code

__GOALS__ 
  -  _`line_fitter_code.py`:_ Write code to generate random linear points, and plot a line of best fit through those points. 
  - _`linear_data_gen.py`:_ Write code to randomly generate linear points along a user-provided gradient and y-intercept value.

__NOTES__ 
  - `linear_data_gen.py` is currently incomplete, as is `line_fitter.py`.
