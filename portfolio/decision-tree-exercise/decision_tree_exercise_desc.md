### Decision Tree Exercise

__GOALS__ 
  -  Using a labelled dataset from the UCL Irvine Repository, train a machine learning model and generate a decision tree using that model. 

__NOTES__ 
  - There are two folders for datasets within this file: `wine-quality` and `youtube-spam-collection`, but the former is the one used to train the model.
